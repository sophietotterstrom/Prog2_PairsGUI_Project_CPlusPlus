----------------------------INSTRUCTIONS AND RULES----------------------------
To configure the number of cards used in the game,
update the int NUMBER_OF_CARDS on line 6 of mainwindow.cpp.

Player 1 starts playing by clicking on a card. The card will turn over
and the letter for the card will be displayed. The player must then select
a second card. The green background color indicates which player is in turn.

If the two cards match, the player gets one point, and the pair of matching
cards will be removed from the game (indicated by grey, unclickable cards).
After finding a match, Player 1 gets another turn.

If the cards don't match, it becomes Player 2's turn. They start their
turn by clicking the "Next Turn" button, which will turn over the non-matching
cards, and change the score of Player 2 to green to indicate the turn change.

Player 2 attempts to find matching pairs, and is awarded points accordingly.
The game continues until all pairs are found. When the game is over, an
alert message will display to announce the winner and their score.

If the two players have tied, the message is shown accordingly.
Clicking OK will dismiss the alert and start a new game.

If desired, a new game can be started at any time by selecting
the "Reset Game" button. (See details regarding this below).


--------------------------------EXTRA FEATURES--------------------------------
1. After the game ends (or anyway), it is possible to start the
game again from the beginning without starting the program again. (10p)
    - This has been implemented with the method "on_resetGameButtonClicked()"
      in mainwindow.cpp. At any time when this button is clicked, the cards
      are turned back, visibility of all FOUND or OPEN cards is set to HIDDEN,
      and score is changed back to zero. Further details on line 129 in
      the mainwindow.cpp.

2. There is a figure on the back of cards (the same figure on all cards). (10 p.)
    - I created a heart in paint and imported it to the project. The image is found
      in the project's Other files under "heart.png". This image has been set to
      be displayed on the backs of all cards.
